Student Directory
=================

Our first project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data. This program runs entirely in the terminal.

Day 1 - directory.rb
---------------------

First attempt at making this student directory with Nicola! We set up our environment and git for this project. The program askes for students' names and put them into a nice array and output them onto the screen.


Day 2 - directory.rb
---------------------
Continued working on the student directory with Michiel. We also add some validation to check user input in our code. We also have an excersize in which we have to fix code without sublime highlighting (typos.rb)


Day 3 - directory.rb
---------------------
Tripled up with Jeremy (@foxjerem) and Peter (@petermccarthy49) today. We added an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do and was successful in saving student data (age and cohort) to a csv file. We did some major refactoring and split a big method into quite a few smaller ones, makeing our code much cleaner.

Day 4 - directory.rb
---------------------
We didn't work on our student directory today to focus on our Friday Challenge on the command line. We will be TDD'ing next week, so this will be the last version of our student directory without tests.
